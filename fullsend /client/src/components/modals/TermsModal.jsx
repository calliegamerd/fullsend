        <ol className={classes.ol}>
          <li>We offer several contests and other features on the Website. You can participate for the chance to win prizes. Our contests are free to play. Our features may change from time to time, at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to modify or cancel contests at any time without notice to You. Contest rules and scoring may differ from contest to contest. Each of our contests are governed by specific rules, as may be modified from time to time, which are set forth in the official rules for each contest and are incorporated into these Terms by this reference.</li>
          <li>You have the responsibility to review the rules prior to participating in any contest, and to review the rules for any changes. You agree to abide by the then-current rules for the contest(s) in which You participate. Your failure to follow the then-current rules for the contest(s) in which You participate will result in Your immediate and automatic forfeiture of the contest(s), and We reserve the right to immediately suspend or terminate Your access to Fullsend.GG.</li>
          <li>Winners are determined by the applicable documentation associated with the contest. Fullsend.GG may not be used for any form of illicit gambling.</li>
          <li>You may make monetary deposits on the site and receive credits to purchase lootboxes. You may also receive free credits by participating in our rain bonus or claiming our free daily case.</li>
          <li>We also offer “Case Battles,” which involve between two and four players. All players purchase a loot box and open the boxes simultaneously. The player with the better item keeps that item and the other players’ prizes.</li>
          <li>Rain – We offer a rewards program called “rain.” A base of 200 credits plus a percentage of all spend on the site during the stated time period (30 minutes) is added to each rain. Each rain lasts for 30 minutes. At the end of this 30-minute period, any eligible user who is over level 1 or has completed the KYC on site can join and receive a equal share of the total pot. Rain is a reward for players to collect while they are actively playing on the site as part of our free to play system. Abusing Rain contrary to its intended purpose, may result in the termination of your account at the sole discretion of the Fullsend.GG.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Results and Winners</h3>
        <ol className={classes.ol}>
          <li>The results and winners of each contest will be determined by Us at Our sole discretion and such determinations are final. We reserve the right to make adjustments based on errors or irregularities in Our calculation of results. We also may make adjustments in the event of noncompliance with the Terms. Any decision by Fullsend.GG as to the winner(s) of a contest shall stand as a final and binding decision. Fullsend.GG has no obligation to delay the awarding of a prize in anticipation of any adjustment, but We reserve the right to reverse prizes in the event of any adjustment. By registering an Account and/or participating in any contest, you unconditionally agree that Fullsend.GG shall serve as the sole judge and arbiter as to the determination of a winner(s) in all contests in the event a dispute arises and agree to cooperate with Our efforts to reverse prizing, as necessary.</li>
          <li>We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to deny any contestant the ability to participate in any contests for any reason whatsoever. Further, Fullsend.GG may, in its sole and absolute discretion, invalidate any contest result for the purposes of preventing abusive and/or any unfair or potentially unlawful activity, or in the event that there is a risk of any such abusive, illegal, or unfair activity.</li>
          <li>Fullsend.GG also reserves the right to cancel contests, in our sole discretion, without any restrictions. Fullsend.GG, in its sole discretion, may disqualify you from a contest or the entire Service, refuse to award prizes and require the return of any prizes, or suspend, limit, or terminate your account if you engage in conduct Fullsend.GG deems, in its sole discretion, to be improper, unfair, fraudulent or otherwise adverse to the operation of the Service or in any way detrimental to other users. Improper conduct includes, but is not limited to: falsifying personal information, including payment information, required to use the Service or claim a prize; violating eligible payment method terms, violating any of these rules, accumulating points or prizes through unauthorized methods such as unauthorized scripts or other automated means; tampering with the administration of the Service or trying to in any way tamper with the computer programs associated with the Service; obtaining other entrants’ information and spamming or being abusive or harassing to other entrants; and abusing the Service in any way; or otherwise violating these Terms of Use. You acknowledge that the forfeiture and/or return of any prize shall in no way prevent Fullsend.GG from informing the relevant authorities, and/or pursuing criminal or civil proceedings in connection with such conduct.</li>
          <li>If for any reason the Service is not running as originally planned (e.g., if the Site becomes corrupted or does not allow the proper usage and processing of entries in accordance with the rules, or if infection by a computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, actions by entrants, fraud, technical failures, or any other causes of any kind, in the sole opinion of Fullsend.GG corrupts or affects the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of the Service), Fullsend.GG reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any individual implicated in or relating to the cause and/or to cancel, terminate, extend, modify or suspend the Service, and select the winner(s) from all eligible entries received. If such cancellation, termination, modification or suspension occurs, notification may be posted on the Website.</li>
          <li>The failure of Fullsend.GG to comply with any provision of these Terms due to an act of God, for example hurricane, war, fire, riot, earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of governmental authorities outside of the control of Fullsend.GG (excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations) or other force majeure event will not be considered a breach of these Terms.</li>
